title: Making with Make
---

I decided that timestamps as markdown files made the most sense for now, mostly because I didn't want to have to think of names for things, and a timestamp is a great replacement for a name, because I can never go wrong dating things. So for a while, I was running `touch content/blog/$(date +%S).md` in the terminal.

I'm really bad about losing commands though, and the easiest way to build a command line interface is `make`, so I added a makefile for common commands I use. In this case, it only has one:

```Makefile
.PHONY: post

post:
	touch content/blog/$(shell date +%s).md
```

Now, I can run `make post` and it'll do the same thing for me as it always was. The other thing this does for me, is I can forget that command forever now because `make post` is what I really want to do.
