title: Initial Thoughts on Eel
---

Eel is a library for connecting python to a webfrontend for localish apps. It's similar to tauri, which I [have used in the past](../1720816319), but enables native interactions with python libraries. I wanted to try this because one of my favorite file based storage utils is written in python, and I maybe want to leverage it for data management for local apps.

However, my initial experience leads me to doubt the viability of Eel for a distributable use case: while it does allow bundling a web based frontend, it doesn't actually bundle a base--either the app is opened in the browser, like a shortcut, or in a chrome window (supposing the user has chrome already installed). There's probably a use case for this, but I don't think distributing apps to a non-technical audience is it.
