title: Getting Started with Tauri
---

[Tauri](https://tauri.app/) is an app shell written in Rust for building JS apps for the desktop--like [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), but rustlang, rather than javascript. I had been using it on my previous machine, but when I tried to build with it on my current laptop, I ran into issues, and I didn't have anything in my [bootstrap](https://github.com/thatrandybrown/bootstrap), so here's what I did:

```bash
brew install rustup-init
rustup-init -y
yarn create tauri-app
```

From there, it worked. The main thing I had forgotten, and which is obfuscated in the docs, is that you need to have rust installed in some form or fashion.
