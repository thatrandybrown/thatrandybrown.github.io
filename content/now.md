# Family

* The boys are doing great in school.
* Jonathan's birthday party this year was groovy monkeys. Stephen's was Link from Breath of the Wild.
* Both boys are absolutely in love with Legos, and in general building stuff.
* Steph has reacquainted herself with reading and puzzles.
* We all love art. Only Steph doesn't have an art bag (yet).

# Home

* We love our home. It is a backlog of projects.
* I have finally started turning the upstairs where I work daily into more than just storage.
* Now that fall has come, I want to work on our courtyard.

# Hobbies

## Video Games

* My minecraft world that I play for the boys reached day 102--the longest running world I've ever played, I think.
* My last progress on Breath of the Wild's Master Mode was to collect the first memory. I still don't have the champions tunic.
* I am on the last battle of the first chapter of Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles.
* I think am in the last dungeon of Link's Awakening (the remastered version on switch) but am missing an item I think I need to get through it, somehow.

## Board Games

* I should write more about this on <a href="/notes">notes</a>.
* The boys are playing tsuro a lot right now.
* Stephen and I play a lot of Guild of Merchant Explorers.
* Jonathan and I play a lot of Monkey Palace or 800 Pound Gorilla.

# Projects and Other Work

## Happy Acorn Ventures

At the start of this year, I started Happy Acorn Ventures. For most of the year, it has sourced income through contracting. In October, it made its first product dollar.

## Programming

### BASM

One weekend in October, I wrote a very small assembly machine that is silly and not very useful, but I'm still proud of it.

### Cog

Cog has proven an interesting enough project that I've now worked on it for nearly six months, slowly adding features.

* parses HTML and prints a DOM
* parses CSS and prints a CSS hierarchy
* can print just the text nodes from a page (newest feature)

### Spyglass

I originally wrote this in python, but will probably port it to rust. This is a very basic document indexing and search utility. It was built to integrate with Cog.
