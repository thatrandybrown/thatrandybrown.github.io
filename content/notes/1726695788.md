title: Dead Links
---

There are throughout these notes dead links. They exist for two reasons:

1. I have written a note but haven't made it public yet--perhaps because it is incomplete, or because my publishing cadence and agenda precludes it for some reason.
2. I have not written the note yet, but want to create a placeholder for thoughts on the subject in the future. This stems from my use of obsidian and logseq, which treat these roads to nowhere special, and provide a to do list for me of things to think about.
