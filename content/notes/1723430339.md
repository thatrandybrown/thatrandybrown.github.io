# Using iCloud for App Data

In XCode right now, two types of apps can be created--an app and a document app.

* Apps are typical apps and manage data and interactions through a single model, interaction, and lifecycle. Examples include calculators and weather apps.
* Document apps interact with multiple documents, each which have their own model, interaction, and lifecycle. Examples include text editors and drawing apps.

Both app types can save data to iCloud. To do so, the iCloud capability needs to be added to the app. However, what iCloud mechanisms can be used varies by app type. **iCloud Drive seems to only be usable by Document Apps**.

Document based apps need save and load dialogs and to be able to manage multiple documents. CloudKit is an alternative that allows for social and collaborative activities.
