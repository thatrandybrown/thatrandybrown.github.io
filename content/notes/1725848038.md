title: The Adventuring Day in Mausritter
---

There are a lot of things that happen in a day in Mausritter. There are over 100 opportunities for encounters in the adventuring day. This is an attempt to provide some checklist of those things for a game master:

- [ ] Start of day: Roll for weather and apply effects
- [ ] Start of day: if a mouse did not take a full rest, give it an exhausted condition
- [ ] Start of day: if a mouse did not eat, give it a hungry condition
- [ ] Start of morning watch: roll an encounter. If there is an encounter, roll the hour it should happen and mark it.
- [ ] Mark a turn for player investigation actions and exploration of a site
- [ ] Mark a turn for combat
- [ ] Mark a turn for a short rest
- [ ] Every three turns: roll an encounter
- [ ] Mark a full watch for a long rest[^1]
- [ ] Mark a full watch (or two!) for travel between hexes
- [ ] Start of evening watch: roll an encounter. If there is an encounter, roll the hour it should happen and mark it.

## Footnotes

[^1]: What happens if the morning or evening encounter happens during a rest?
