# Randy Brown

## About Me

### Who I am

Husband and Dad of two small boys. I like video games, books, board games, legos, and playing with new technology. I hope to get my masters in mathematics eventually.

### What I do

Support DevProd, DevEx, DevOps, Technology Council, Frontend Guild, etc.

### Why I am Here

I had to find a way to use my powers for good, after working in enterprise banking and other startups, and joined cerebral because of the social impact mission.

### How I Work

Working within the art of the possible, taking consensus driven actions, and running toward fire

## Receiving Feedback and Praise

Feedback is a gift. I encourage, anticipate, and deisre regular feedback on how I can improve.

I am most receptive to feedback privately in a 1-1 with specific examples of behaviors to keep, improve, start, or stop, or otherwise change. In particular, if you are able to tie this feedback to how it impacts my growth and ability to support others it is helpful.

## Communication and Work Style

### Communication Style

Chipper and Conversational. I'll probably start a conversation by saying hi and asking how things are going, even if I need something or if there's an urgent matter. People first.

### Slack Management

For everything, I consider Slack my main communication platform. Please slack, over email, if you want a response. Sending me an email is the best way to guarantee I will not respond. :)

I don't expect prompt responses, unless I otherwise denote it as urgent. 12 hour SLAs with responses during working hours. I try to schedule messages to send during the workday, but sometimes I forget.

I try to go computers off between 430 PM and 830 PM CST and on the weekends--this is dedicated family time. If urgent, you can text or page me.

I manage slack a bit like it's own todo list--flagging messages with reminders, and following up when I've got more bandwidth or am not in some heads down work.

### Meeting Preferences

I live by the phrase 'it takes a heck of a meeting to beat no meeting at all'. I encourage regular reflection and feedback on whether or not we should be having a meeting.

Having a TLDR or an Objective for a meeting going into it would be great. Any documentation I can review is best attached to the meeting itself.

### Documentation

I encourage a writing culture and recommend all related docs are as close to their relevant reference as possible: code docs in repositories, meeting docs attached to meetings. jira as a source of centralization for reference docs for tickets and tasks.
