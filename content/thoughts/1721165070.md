Get started with git:

1. Create a new repo

```zsh
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
```

2. Track changes on a file

```zsh
touch README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "add a readme"
```

3. Make changes to a file

```zsh
echo "# My Project" > README.md
git add -p # type y to add changes to a changeset
git commit -m "provide a title to the readme"
```
